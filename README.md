# ENT Surgery Support Chatbot
### Capstone Project Repository for 4ZP6A
---
#### Topic:
ENT-Surgery-Support-Chatbot  

Note: This topic is a merge between two of the listed potential projects: Language Model for an ENT Surgery Chatbot (Topic #15) and Chatbot Application for ENT Surgery Patients (Topic #14)

#### Project Description:
Individuals who require ENT surgery often have a difficult time obtaining all relevant information about the procedures before consenting to and undergoing surgery. This means that they either consent without having sufficient information - and then issues arise during or post surgery - or they attempt to obtain as much information as possible during short doctor's visits - and end up overwhelmed or with large amounts of superficial information. The goal of this project is to:
1. Design and build an application or website that will provide relevant information to ENT patients
2. Develop a small language model on relevant surgery information that patients can chat with to obtain information procedures
