#### Desired Topic:
Language Model for an ENT Surgery Chatbot Lin (Topic #15)  
Supervised by Dr. Denise Geiskkovitch (geiskkod@mcmaster.ca) and Dr. Charles Welch
In collaboration with Dr. Benjamin van der Woerd

#### Project Description:
Individuals who require ENT surgery often have a difficult time obtaining all relevant information about the procedures before consenting to and undergoing surgery. This means that they either consent without having sufficient information - and then issues arise during or post surgery - or they attempt to obtain as much information as possible during short doctor's visits - and end up overwhelmed or with large amounts of superficial information. The goal of this project is to develop a small language model on relevant surgery information that patients can chat with to obtain information procedures.
