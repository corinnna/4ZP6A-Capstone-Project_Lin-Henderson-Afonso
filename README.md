# 4ZP6A Capstone Project 2024
### Capstone Project Repository for 4ZP6A

#### Desired Topic:
Language Model for an ENT Surgery Chatbot Lin (Topic #14)  
Supervised by Dr. Denise Geiskkovitch (geiskkod@mcmaster.ca) and Dr. Charles Welch

#### Project Description:
Individuals who require ENT surgery often have a difficult time obtaining all relevant information about the procedures before consenting to and undergoing surgery. This means that they either consent without having sufficient information - and then issues arise during or post surgery - or they attempt to obtain as much information as possible during short doctor's visits - and end up overwhelmed or with large amounts of superficial information. The goal of this project is to design and build an application or website that will provide relevant information to ENT patients.
